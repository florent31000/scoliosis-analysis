Personal project: use ML and image processing for scoliosis worsening diagnosis

This is not realy usable by anyone else than me, as the files that are processed by this code comes from real patients and are confidential.

However, some parts of the code can be reused on other projects:
- find the best candidate for vertical symetry axis
- turn a 2D contour lines pictures back into 3D data
